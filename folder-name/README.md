## Summary
` public class HelloWorld {} `
- File name should be same as class name because of access specifier “public”
- Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class.
- The class Name should always start with an Uppercase First Letter.
- When saving the file, save it using the class name and add ".java" to the end of the filename. 

` public static void main (String [] args) `
- Every program must contain the main() method. 
- Any code inside the main() method will be executed.
- Static keyword used to avoid the creation of object for the class file

` System.out.println(“Hello World”) `
- The curly braces {} marks the beginning and the end of a block of code.
- System is a built-in Java class that contains useful members, such as out, which is short for "output" is a object instance variable of PrintStream class. The 
  println() method, short for "print line", is used to print a value to the screen (or a file) is method of PrintStream class.
- Each code statement must end with a semicolon (;).

  ##### VS Code 
- javac filename.java	==> compile into byte code (filename.class)
- java filename		==> run the class file

==> java filename.java <== run java code in single command
